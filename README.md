### Project name: 
# :calendar: Studying To Do List :pushpin: :books:

This is a home work from Factoria F5-Barcelona bootcamp. <br>
I am about to create an exercise for working with API REST, using a local server to handle the CRUD to organize my home works. <br>
It's all about Fron-End. <br>

# Skills :muscle:

This are some of the skills I'm using in to present the work made.
- JavaScript :hushed:
- HMTL :sunglasses:
- CSS :sunglasses:

# Self Challenges :see_no_evil:

- I'm at the moment learning Javascript so I don't feel very comfy when it comes to it.
- I'll try not to use any kind of template like Bootstrap, all as handmade as it can be.

# If reading this, let yourself to write a constructive comment, I'll answers as fast as I can.
